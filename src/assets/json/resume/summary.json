My primary mission was to modernize the API development process. I had the opportunity to completely overhaul the existing API system. It was noted that all Run Services websites utilized the same client form, thus I was tasked with standardizing their usage of a unified API. Additionally, I implemented web services alongside the API to handle specific information such as price calculations or customer file acceptance.",
